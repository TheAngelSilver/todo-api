Overview
The To-Do List API is a RESTful web service designed for managing to-do tasks. It allows users to:

Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Store data persistently in a MongoDB database.
Handle requests and responses using a lightweight and scalable architecture.
Key Characteristics:

Modular Design: Separates concerns like routing, database models, and middleware.
Scalability: Easily extendable for new features like authentication and advanced filtering.
Stateless API: Follows REST principles, where each request contains all necessary information.
Core Architecture

1. RESTful Design Principles
   Stateless Communication: Each request is self-contained, with no server-side session state.
   Resource-Oriented: Tasks are treated as resources accessible via standard HTTP methods.
   Standardized Status Codes: HTTP status codes indicate success or failure.
2. Three-Tier Architecture
   The application is organized into three distinct layers:

Presentation Layer: Handles incoming HTTP requests and sends back HTTP responses.
Framework: Express.js
Business Logic Layer: Processes requests, applies business rules, and orchestrates database interactions.
Data Layer: Manages persistence using MongoDB through the Mongoose library.

Key Components
models/: Defines the schema and model for database entities.
routes/: Handles URL endpoints and maps them to controllers.
controllers/: Contains the logic for processing API requests.
middleware/: Encapsulates reusable functions like error handling.
config/: Stores configuration logic, such as database connection details.
tests/: Includes test cases to ensure the API behaves as expected.
Data Flow
Request: A client sends an HTTP request to an API endpoint.
Example: POST /api/todos with a JSON body.
Routing: The request is routed via routes/todoRoutes.js to the appropriate controller method.
Controller: The todoController.js processes the request, applying business logic.
Database Interaction: The controller interacts with the Todo model (models/Todo.js) to read or write data in MongoDB.
Response: The processed data or error message is returned as an HTTP response.
Example Data Flow:

Client: Sends a POST request to create a task:
json
Copy code
{
"title": "Write Architecture.md"
}
Server:
Route: /api/todos → createTodo() in todoController.js
Controller: Validates input and saves the task using the Todo model.
Database: Saves the task in MongoDB.
Response: Sends back the created task with a 201 Created status.
API Endpoints
Method Endpoint Description Request Body
POST /api/todos Create a new to-do { "title": "Task Title" }
GET /api/todos Retrieve all to-dos None
PUT /api/todos/:id Update an existing to-do { "completed": true }
DELETE /api/todos/:id Delete a to-do None
Technologies Used
Technology Purpose
Node.js Runtime environment for executing JavaScript
Express.js Framework for building the API
MongoDB NoSQL database for storing tasks
Mongoose ODM for MongoDB, defining schemas
dotenv Manages environment variables
Nodemon Development tool for auto-restarting server
Design Decisions
MongoDB for Flexibility:
Chosen for its schema-less nature, allowing easy addition of new fields (e.g., priorities or categories).

Express.js for Simplicity:
A lightweight framework suitable for building RESTful APIs efficiently.

Modular Structure:
Each component (model, route, controller) is separated for better maintainability and scalability.

Future Improvements
Short-Term
Add input validation using Joi or express-validator.
Introduce centralized logging (e.g., Winston or Morgan).
Mid-Term
Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
Add search, filtering, and sorting capabilities.
Long-Term
Transition to microservices for better scalability.
Deploy with containerization (Docker) for easier orchestration.
Conclusion
This architecture ensures the To-Do List API is modular, maintainable, and scalable. The structure is designed to support future enhancements while remaining accessible for beginners.
