Project Roadmap
This document outlines the goals, milestones, and planned features for the To-Do List API project. The roadmap ensures the project remains focused, tracks progress, and identifies areas for future enhancement.

Project Goals
Short-Term Goals (1-2 Weeks)
Set up the development environment.
Design the API structure with CRUD operations.
Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Create and test RESTful endpoints:
Create a to-do.
Retrieve all to-dos.
Update a to-do by ID.
Delete a to-do by ID.
Handle basic error responses (e.g., 404 for non-existent resources).
Deploy the API on a live platform (Render or Heroku).
Mid-Term Goals (3-4 Weeks)
Implement input validation using a library like Joi.
Add middleware for better error handling (e.g., centralized error handler).
Introduce logging for debugging and tracking (e.g., Winston or Morgan).
Write unit tests for the API using Jest and Supertest.
Document the API endpoints using Swagger or Postman Collections.
Long-Term Goals (1-3 Months)
Add user authentication and authorization using JWT.
Allow to-dos to be private or shared between users.
Introduce priority levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) for tasks.
Implement search and filtering capabilities for to-dos.
Create task categories for better organization.
Build a frontend client to interact with the API (e.g., React.js or Angular).
Deploy the project as a full-stack application (frontend + backend).
Milestones
Version 1.0.0
Initial release of the To-Do List API.
Features:
CRUD operations.
MongoDB integration.
Basic error handling.
Deployment: Fully functional API hosted on a live platform.
Version 1.1.0
Enhancements:
Input validation.
Centralized error handling.
Basic unit tests for API endpoints.
Version 2.0.0
User-centric features:
Authentication and authorization (JWT).
Private vs. shared to-dos.
Priority levels and categories for tasks.
Search and filtering capabilities.
Version 3.0.0
Full-stack application:
Frontend client to consume the API.
Integration with frontend frameworks like React.js or Angular.
Enhanced UX/UI for managing tasks.
Planned Features and Tasks
Phase 1: Core Functionality
Setup and configure the development environment.
Design and build the to-do model in MongoDB.
Implement CRUD operations for managing to-dos.
Test endpoints manually using Postman.
Deploy the API on Render or Heroku.
Phase 2: API Improvements
Add validation for required fields and constraints using Joi.
Create middleware for better error handling and response formatting.
Introduce API documentation with Swagger or Postman Collections.
Add logging with Winston or Morgan.
Phase 3: User Management
Implement user authentication (signup/login) with JWT.
Associate tasks with users for personalized task management.
Add role-based access control for shared to-dos.
Phase 4: Advanced Features
Add support for task priorities and categories.
Implement search functionality for tasks by title or category.
Build filters for completed vs. pending tasks.
Provide sorting options (e.g., by priority, creation date).
Phase 5: Frontend Integration
Create a responsive and intuitive frontend using React.js or Angular.
Connect the frontend to the backend API.
Allow users to manage tasks visually via the frontend.
Deployment Plans
Phase 1: API Deployment
Set up a GitHub repository for the project.
Deploy the backend API to:
Render (preferred for simplicity).
Heroku (as an alternative).
Phase 2: Full-Stack Deployment
Deploy the frontend client to platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
Host both frontend and backend on a single domain using reverse proxying (e.g., NGINX).
Success Metrics
Short-Term Success:
A functional API accessible via a live URL.
All endpoints tested and operational.
Mid-Term Success:
Robust input validation and error handling.
Documented and tested endpoints.
Long-Term Success:
Comprehensive user features (authentication, categories, search).
A polished full-stack application deployed for public use.
